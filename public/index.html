      content="CryptoAthletes are 10,000 unique players balling on the Ethereum Blockchain in style. With different chains, teams, hair, and more fashionable styles, there are more than 450,000,000 different possible options for our ballers, but only 10,000 are made. All players will be randomly generated, this means no 2 players will be the same. We have a unique ranking system, some ballers might be better than others, but there will never be a bad baller!"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
